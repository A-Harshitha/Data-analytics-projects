## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of loan defaulters. The analysis aimed to identify key patterns and insights that could help in segmenting defaulters and understanding the factors contributing to loan defaults.

## Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates
- Handled inconsistent data entries

## Imputation
- Imputed missing values using mean, mode, and median techniques

## Outlier Removal
- Identified and removed outliers

## Conclusions and Insights
- Identified in-depth conclusions and insights from the data analysis

## Recommendations and Precautions
- Recommended safe targets and precautions to reduce risk

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:
- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive exploration)

## Usage
To view and run the analysis:
1. Clone the repository:
   
     git clone <https://github.com/A-Harshitha/Data-analytics-projects>
   
2.Navigate to the project directory:

     cd EDA-Loan-Defaulter-Segmentation
   
3.Ensure all required libraries are installed:

     pip install -r requirements.txt
   
Open and run the Python file using any Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
