# Maven Hospital Challenge: Power BI Dashboard Development

## Project Overview
I participated in the Maven Hospital Challenge and developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard comprising four key dashboards, each providing valuable insights into hospital data.

## Dashboards

- **Overview Dashboard:** Offers a snapshot of critical KPIs, including total patients, total procedures, covered procedures, and the amount covered by insurance. This dashboard provides users with essential metrics and overall performance at a glance.

- **Insurance Analysis Dashboard:** Provides detailed insights into insurance payers and their contributions to patient care. It includes analysis of insurance coverage patterns, payer contributions, and their financial impact on hospital operations.

- **Patient Analysis Dashboard:** Displays detailed information on patient encounters, demographics, and disease distribution by age classification. This dashboard aids in understanding patient profiles and identifying trends in demographics and health conditions.

- **Average Stay Analysis Dashboard:** Analyzes average patient stay durations with monthly and yearly trends, including insights by age group. This dashboard is designed to optimize hospital resource management by revealing patterns in patient stay lengths.
